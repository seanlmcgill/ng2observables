#Angular2: Working with Observables

Working on an Angular2 project with TypeScript has felt very intuative to me, having come from a more classical object-oriented background.  I've done plenty of ES5 JavaScript style development as well,
but there's just something nice about having classes back in ES2015/TypeScript back that sits well in my brain.  One aspect however took a bit of tinkering was using observables, having been used to using
JavaScript promises for quite a while now.  Having some experience with them now I feel they're more elegant than promises and think it's a nice design pattern, here's a few situations I ran into:

###Import RxJS Operators

###Return Static Test Data from a Service

###Abstract Results from Multiple Services

###Wait for Multiple Observables
